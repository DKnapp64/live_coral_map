      <p class="flow-text">Coral and the algae living inside its tissues depend on each other to survive. Coral bleaching occurs when corals become stressed and the algae is expelled, resulting in whitening of the animal. Corals are extremely vulnerable at this point and are subject to mortality.</p>

      <p class="flow-text">Ocean heatwaves are becoming more and more common due to climate change. Ocean heatwaves cause stress on reefs and are the main cause of coral bleaching that often leads to coral death. The Hawaiian Islands are now entering ocean heatwave conditions, with coral bleaching already reported in several locations on the islands. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Coral Reef Watch has upgraded current alert levels to their highest setting.</p>

      <p class="flow-text">This website provides real-time updates on the locations of probable coral bleaching caused by the 2019 ocean heatwave. Here, for the first time in the world, we combine citizen science, expert science, and satellites to track the effects of the ocean heatwave on coral reefs. Powered by more than 100 Planet Lab satellites 300 miles up in Earth orbit, we are monitoring all of Hawaii's coral reefs every day, providing a weekly update on any bleaching that we detect.</p>
      <p class="flow-text">In parallel to our satellite monitoring, we have deployed our aircraft and field teams across the Hawaiian Islands to map corals and to identify bleaching. We need this information to verify the satellite information and confirm bleaching is occurring.</p>

      <p class="flow-text">We need your help to make this work for the future of coral reefs in Hawaii. Firstly, with this web interface, you can enter your field observations of bleached coral like that shown in these photos from the 2015 ocean heatwave in Hawaii. Please log your observations, which will be immediately communicated to us, Hawaii-DAR, and the conservation community. Our interactive map provides a direct link between ocean users and the first-ever satellite coral bleaching detection system.</p>
      <p class="flow-text">Secondly, the State of Hawaii Division of Aquatic Resources (Hawaii-DAR), has asked all ocean users to reduce secondary stress on coral reefs. Our website identifies reefs that are bleaching and thus as an ocean user, you can identify locations where it is a priority to reduce secondary stressors and protect Hawaii's corals for the future.</p>

Our science generates solution pathways for the conservation, management and decision-making communities as well as for the public. This website was launched on short notice with backing from Paul Allen's Vulcan Inc., Pew Trust's Lenfest Ocean Program, One Earth, and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation. ASU-GDCS is working with Hawaii-DAR and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to generate information and solutions to coral reef challenges across the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
